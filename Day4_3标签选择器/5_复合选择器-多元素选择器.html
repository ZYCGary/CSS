    <h2>Changing courses</h2>
    <p class="p_1">
        If you hold a Student visa and are thinking about changing your course of study, ensure that you continue to meet all the conditions that apply to your student visa.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you have not completed six months of your principal course (the main course of study you are undertaking) and you want to change your education provider, the ESOS National Code explains the circumstances in which this will be possible. Unless special circumstances apply, you usually need to have permission from your existing education provider to transfer to another education provider.
    </p>

    <h2>Students holding a Student visa (subclass 500)</h2>
    <p>
        If you already have a student visa and want to change your main course of study to a lower Australian Qualification Framework (AQF) level course or a non-AQF level course, you will generally need a new student visa.
    </p>
    <p>
        This requirement applies even if the course you change to is with the same education provider.
